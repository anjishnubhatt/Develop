This code performs sales forecasting for multiple stores using Prophet time series forecasting library. Let's break down the code and understand its functionality:

The code begins by importing the required libraries and disabling warnings.

Next, the code loads the input data, including the store sales data, holiday data, and discount data, using pd.read_csv().

The create_features() function is defined to create additional features based on rolling mean windows, lag periods, and holiday and discount information.

The code converts the 'date' column to a datetime type and specifies the rolling mean windows and lag periods.

A predictions list is initialized to store the forecasted results.

The code proceeds to create a store dataframe (store_df) to combine the sales data, missing dates, and additional features for each store.

The dataframe is sorted by date, missing dates are inserted, and missing sales values are filled with 0.

Additional features are created using the create_features() function, and the resulting dataframe is concatenated with the store_df dataframe.

The code then defines a function, is_holiday(), to determine if a given date is a holiday, and another function, get_discount_flag(), to determine the discount flag for a given date.

The next section of the code focuses on model training and prediction.

The input dataframe (store_df) is copied into df for further processing.

The code splits the dataset into training and test sets using a cutoff date. The last 8 weeks of data are reserved for testing, and the rest is used for training.

Hyperparameter values to try are defined in the hyperparameters dictionary.

For each unique store in the training set, the code iterates over the hyperparameter combinations and uses the Prophet library to train and evaluate models.

The best hyperparameters and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for each store are stored in the best_mape_per_store dictionary.

The code then predicts sales for the next 8 weeks using the best hyperparameters for each store.

Finally, the forecasted sales for each store and week are stored in the forecast_df dataframe, which is printed at the end.

In summary, this code combines store sales data with additional features, trains Prophet models for each store using different hyperparameter combinations, evaluates the models using MAPE, and provides sales forecasts for the next 8 weeks for each store. The code allows for efficient forecasting and analysis across multiple stores using a variety of machine learning algorithms.
